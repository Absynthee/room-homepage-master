## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- ES6 JavaScript
- Popover API

### What I learned

It has been a while since I've done one of these challenges, and I'd like to think that my skills have improved since last time. The most difficult part for me was getting the carousel to work, and creating the mobile navigation using the Popover API, instead of JS.
